# ML_Final_Project
Comparison of the difference between Neural Networks and Naive Bayes over the MNIST dataset.

## MNIST
Support for MNIST can be found [here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).
For ease of use during the project I used a csv of the MNIST found [here](https://pjreddie.com/projects/mnist-in-csv/).
